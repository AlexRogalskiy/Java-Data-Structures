# Union Find

**What kind of problems are commonly solved via union find:**

- Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (minimum spanning tree algorithm) applied further in landing cables, tour operations and TV network
- Computing the shorelines of a terrain
- Classifying a set of atoms into molecules or fragments
- Connected component labeling in image analysis
- Generating a maze
- Grid perlocation
- Least common ancestor in trees
- Alias analysis in compiler theory
- Maintaining the connected components of an undirected-graph, when the adges are being added dynamically
- Board games such as Carcasonne
