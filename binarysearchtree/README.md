# Binary Search Tree
**Statement: Binary trees become truly useful for searching when you balance them**

**What kind of problems are commonly solved via binary search tree:**

- Used in search applications having data entering/leaving in a constant way (e.g., *map*/*set* objects languages libraries.
- Binary heaps - higher keys are above or equal to lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right).
- Hash trees, similar to hash tables.
- Implementing routing table in router.
- To solve database problem such as indexing.
- Data compression code.
- Organization of Morse code.
- Recursively evaluated mathematical expression. 
- Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages.
- Huffman trees for compression of data.
- Routing trees for network traffic.
